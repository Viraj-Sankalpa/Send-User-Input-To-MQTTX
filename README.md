# send_message from flutter app to MQTTX

A new Flutter project.

## Flutter ==> MQTT

Welcome to my Flutter app for sending user messages to MQTTX! This app allows users to input messages and send them to an MQTT broker using the MQTTX library. With a simple and intuitive user interface, this app is perfect for anyone looking to quickly and easily send messages to an MQTT broker. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate MQTT into your own app, or just someone who wants to experiment with MQTT, this app is a great place to start.
